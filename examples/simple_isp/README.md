# Simple ISP Example

A simple example for working from input file and storing data to an output file, for demo purpose.

To build:

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

To run it on the input `.raw` image in this directory:

```
sh run.sh
```

This will produce a matching `.corrected.jpeg` file.
